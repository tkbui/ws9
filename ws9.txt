1) Write a shell script that samples a random x% of the lines in the input file. Your shell script's name is
   "randomsample.sh".  It is called like this:
      $ ./randomsample.sh x fileinput
   where x is an integer, x > 0 and x < 100 (x range is [1..99] inclusive). Both x and fileinput are required
   parameters, represented in your script as $1 and $2. If either of these parameters are missing the script exits.
   The script will print to stdout (echo) a random x% sampling of all lines in the input file.

Aubrey and his close friend Dr, Steven Maturin this is the best book in the   series to stsrt from. Returning from a long campaign as a   Commander Jack &amp; Steven spend a long spell in England.   O'Brian introduces us to their future wives and his sights  and sounds of English country life will transport you back to  early 19th century England. A rousing tale that ends with  Jack becoming a Post Captain. No one captures the language   of the times like O'Brian and you will want to read all of the  16 volumes that make up this series.     The Aubrey-Maturin stories are the best in this genre.	1995-10-22

The author stuggles through the same rugged terrain over which the fire pursued the somkejumpers, and helps us feel the nearly insurmountable difficulty of outrunning a fire uphill in the dry season. The story moves towards the inevitable conclusion with power and compassion.  I highly recommend it	1995-12-30

A fast reader or one cursed with a good memory will see constant repitition of minor interesting points in several chapters, making the book feel padded.  I'd pass on this one	1995-12-29

The essays at the start of the book explain in good  detail why evolution is a fact, and why Evolutionary  Theory, which describes that fact, is not a fact--- a  distinction that few Creationists CHOOSE to understand.  One essay discusses why young-Earth Creationists believe  what they believe; another explains biogenesis (which is  seperate and distinct from evolution--- biogenesis covers  how life began, while evolution is the process of changes  among that life afterwards); two essays discuss the latests  &quot;monkey trials&quot; whereby Creationists attempted to bypass  the rules of science and used politics instead to force  their religion into public schools. All in all, an  EXCELLENT book.	1995-12-27

John McPhee is a master at weaving many stories together into a coherent whole.  Here he uses these skills to paint a  portrait of the varied and often conflicting interests that  co-habit today's Alaska.  He shifts perspective, examining now the modern-day pioneer who seeks to escape the modern world, and  then the representatives of that same world, the government  agents and politicians who have their own agenda for America's largest state.  This book is wonderfully written in a lucid, literary prose.  McPhee puts many other writers of non-fiction, and many of our best literary writers, to shame	1995-12-26

For a book that is basically suppose to be for self   enlightenment why did the author go to this hokey story line.  He would have been better off writing it as a straight book  for enlightenment... That is if he could write!!!! If you want   to see what writing is all about read Umberto Eco's new   magnificent novel &quot;The Island Of The Day Before&quot;.    A guess to sell a best seller today you need to write to the  level of the masses.. A sad commentary on our times.	1995-10-22

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXPLANATION: First, I create the shell script in nano. I removed the text generated from running nano in script since
it's a lot of ugly text, but I show the script I wrote after the nano command in the screen capture. Basically, I
do an if-elif-else statement, where the script checks if there are 2 arguments passed, if the number is between 1 and
99, and if the file exists. If all are true, then I calculate the number of random rows to print out by using the
line count of the passed in file and the percentage number that was passed in. I use a counter to keep track of how
many lines I print out and when that counter reaches the same number of lines I calculated, then the while loop ends.
In the while loop, I use $RANDOM to randomly get either 0 or 1. If 1, I'll print the current line and increment my
counter, else I go to the next line. This is to prevent duplicates. I also include echo statements to show the cal-
culated number of lines to get from the file, the random 0 or 1 that I calculate, the number of the row I'm printing,
and then the actual row.
When testing the script, I first test the error catching. Then I get subsets of the amazon file because just 1% of 
the amazon file is 31,000 lines and it had already taken me a long time to test it on my own. Since the subset sizes 
are 100 and 200 lines respectively, I show that the script correctly calculates that 3% of each subset would be 3 
lines for the subset of 100 lines, or 6 lines for the subset of 200 lines. I ran the script on the subset of 200 
lines twice since it coincidentally got 1 every time when deciding whether to print lines, and printed the first 6 
lines. Finally, I edited the script to take away all of the extra print statements and ran it again on the subset of
100 lines with the expectation to print a random 3% of the file, and it correctly prints 3 random lines from the subset.
